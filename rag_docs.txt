[PROJECT] AI Bots Multitenant Manager | Mindcraft is an open-source project that connects a Minecraft bot to a large language model (LLM) to interact with players in-game. The current repository provides a solution enabling users to automatically and easily deploy a Mindcraft server on demand via a web interface. The architecture relies on three separate servers: one for the React/Next.js dashboard, one for the Mindcraft containers + FastAPI backend, and one for an LLM proxy (LiteLLM). The goal is to simplify multi-user deployment, secure and restrict access to LLM models, and allow centralized management via the dashboard.
[PROJECT] DockerizeLLM | DockerizeLLM is a Python script that automates the downloading and deployment of LLM models (in gguf format) from Hugging Face, using `llama.cpp` as the backend engine. It builds a Docker container including an OpenAI-compatible API (via `llama-cpp-python[server]`) and enables serving the model locally. Users can search for a model, download it, then build and run the Docker image following interactive script steps. The container exposes the API on port 2600, accessible for `chat/completions` requests.
[PROJECT] Hackathon – Detection of AI-Generated Texts | A 4-day hackathon project aimed at creating a detector for AI-generated texts (e.g., ChatGPT) in an educational context. The dataset used contains 17,000 essays (human-written vs AI-generated). The pipeline includes data exploration, text cleaning, vectorization with FastText, and supervised model training (Random Forest, SVM, etc.). The final model is deployed via Flask with a web interface to test texts. The API returns the probability that a text is AI-generated. Performance may be limited due to a truncated deployed version.
[PROJECT] Tax Gap Analysis – TFPB 2021 | Exploratory analysis of tax gaps on property tax (Taxe Foncière sur les Propriétés Bâties, TFPB) in France (2021 data). Conducted as part of an application for a BI analyst role in the public sector, the project aimed to detect anomalies between collected and expected amounts. Used data analysis tools to evaluate the stability of the tax model and create visualizations identifying tax gaps at departmental and national levels (PowerBI).
